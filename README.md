# Kvasircapsule-SEG (An open access dataset for capsule endosocpy polyp segmentation)

The repository contains the Kvasircapsule-seg dataset. It includes 55 medically verified video capsule frames polyp frames.  We have annotated the polyp class of KvasirCapsule and generated corresponding ground truth masks. This dataset can be used for semantic image segmentation task, meta-learning, domain generalization, and out-of-distribution detection task.

The official website for the dataset is:

The Kvasir-Capsule can be downloaded this github repository and the dropbox link: [https://www.dropbox.com/home/KvasirCapsule-SEG](https://www.dropbox.com/home/KvasirCapsule-SEG).
